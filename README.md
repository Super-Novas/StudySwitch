## Inspiration
---
As ambitious students, we are constantly striving for greater productivity. Our team, comprised of high school and college students alike, all share the common struggle of staying productive. Despite this universal challenge, productivity tools are often scattered across various applications. Recognizing this need, we created StudySwitch - a comprehensive, all-in-one productivity Chrome extension.

<br>

## What it does
---
StudySwitch is centered around our innovative switch feature, which allows users to seamlessly transition between two powerful tools: a comprehensive to-do list and a highly effective pomodoro timer. With a sleek and minimalistic design, users can easily focus on each tool without being overwhelmed, all while having the convenience of both tools being in one place.

## How we built it
---
We developed StudySwitch by first crafting the popup HTML document and styling the slider. We then simultaneously worked on both the pomodoro timer and to-do list, editing the HTML, CSS, and JS on various machines. We subsequently integrated these elements into a single page, and ensured a clean and minimalistic aesthetic. Finally, we added a convenient dark mode switch to the extension, ensuring a comfortable and customizable user experience.

## Challenges we ran into
---
One of the main challenges we faced during the project was working with Chrome Storage. The process was very tedious and we had to learn and understand how the Chrome Storage API worked, and then implement it with the elements of our project. Another challenge was encountered when creating a to-do list feature, specifically with creating the visual effects for the text and checkbox, such as making the text fade out and disappear. Lastly, we had challenges with CSS, specifically making everything minimalistic and adding cool transitions and effects. All these challenges were significant but with the effort and hard work of our team we were able to overcome them and complete the project.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
---
As we started development of StudySwitch, we faced the challenge of working with a novel programming use case: Chrome extensions. We were able to successfully manipulate various CSS properties and JS functions to effectively work with the Chrome Storage API, which proved to be a significant accomplishment. Additionally, our ability to seamlessly implement the dark mode and fade out effects in the to-do list feature came as a pleasant surprise and further exemplifies the potential of our team's capabilities.

## What we learned
---
Through the challenges and frustrations of creating StudySwitch, we collectively gained valuable insights and knowledge. Each team member sharpened their skills in areas such as CSS, JS, and design experimentation. Furthermore, we strengthened our teamwork skills and fostered a strong sense of camaraderie within our team over the course of 24 hours. Additionally, we honed our ability to effectively communicate technical ideas, which was vital in achieving our shared goal.

## What's next for StudySwitch
---
StudySwitch has a lot planned for the future, including API integration. Specifically, we are working on integrating Spotify API for music and ambient noise, OpenAI API for text summarization, Grammarly API for spell and grammar check, a built-in AD Blocker, speech-to-text for note-taking during lectures and text-to-speech integration on websites. These are all things we wanted to implement during the hackathon, however, we aren't able to accomplish this within the timeframe.
